# NUMERU

**Numerical Methods & AI in Pure Rust (std-only)**  
_Work-In-Progress ‚Äî API subject to rapid change_

---

## ‚ú® Vision

NUMERU aims to deliver a **fast, memory-efficient, fully type-safe** foundation for numerical computing and machine-learning in Rust ‚Äî **without depending on external C/Fortran libraries or even `std` extensions.**  
When finished, the crate family will let you:

* Manipulate **const-generic N-D tensors** with zero-copy views, broadcasting, masking, and Python-style slicing.
* Execute high-performance **linear-algebra kernels** (GEMM, LU, QR, Cholesky‚Ä¶) built on portable-SIMD, multi-threading, and optional CUDA offload.
* Train classical ML models (linear/regularised regression, trees, SVM, k-NN, Na√Øve Bayes) and state-of-the-art DL architectures (Transformers, VAEs, GANs, Diffusion) **entirely in Rust**.
* Run fully-featured **autograd**, optimiser, scheduler, and trainer stacks ‚Äî with LoRA adapters, mixed precision, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipelines.
* Save, load, and exchange artefacts via a compact binary **`.nmr` format** or **ONNX** export.

Everything is developed in **small, test-driven increments**; every commit keeps CI green.

## üî© Core Principles

| Principle | What it means here |
|-----------|-------------------|
| **Performance First** | 32-byte-aligned buffers, cache-blocked kernels, portable-SIMD, built-in thread pool, future CUDA kernels. |
| **Safety by Default** | Bounds-checked interfaces in debug builds, `unsafe` contained in leaf modules, Miri-clean codebase. |
| **Compile-Time Guarantees** | Const-generic shapes, deterministic broadcasting, compile-time reduction axes, nightly features (`generic_const_exprs`, `std::simd`). |
| **In-Place Everything** | Every heavy operation accepts a destination buffer to avoid unwanted allocations. |
| **Extensibility** | Trait-based APIs, parameter groups, callback hooks, rule-based configuration. |
| **Pure‚ÄêRust Std-Only** | No `ffi`, no `rand`, no Rayon; we build what we need and treat the standard library as the boundary. |
